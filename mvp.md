# Proposed Build Strategy for Node.js Command-line Git QA Tool

Below is a step-by-step outline for implementing the project using Node.js, based on the specified architecture.

## 1. Project Initialization
1. Initialize a new Node.js project with "npm init" to create a package.json file.
2. Install core dependencies (simple-git, commander, chalk, handlebars, chart.js) and development dependencies (jest, eslint).
3. Create the directory structure as outlined in architecture.md, including:
   - bin/
   - src/commands/
   - src/lib/git/
   - src/lib/analysis/
   - src/report/templates/
   - tests/
4. Configure npm scripts for linting, testing, and running the CLI.

## 2. CLI Interface Development
1. Create the main executable script "bin/git-qa".
2. Set up "commander.js" for parsing command-line arguments such as:
   - analyze [options]
     - --branches
     - --since
     - --output
     - --format
3. Configure the "bin" field in package.json to allow global CLI usage (e.g., via npm link or npm install -g).

## 3. Git Integration Module
1. In "src/lib/git/", develop a validation function to confirm if the current directory is a Git repository.
2. Implement functions that retrieve commit logs using "simple-git", including:
   - Date range filtering
   - Branch selection
   - Author filtering
3. Ensure the module provides structured commit data for downstream analysis.

## 4. Commit Analysis Engine
1. In "src/lib/analysis/", develop modules to parse commit messages and detect keywords like "fix" or "hotfix".
2. Implement logic to identify relevant patterns (e.g., frequently changed files, bug-fixing trends).
3. Calculate metrics needed for reporting, such as commit frequency or defect-fix rates.

## 5. Report Generation System
1. In "src/report/", create modules for formatting data into different output formats:
   - Console (text-based)
   - CSV files
   - HTML with Handlebars templates
2. Use "chart.js" for server-side chart rendering, embedding charts into HTML reports.
3. Organize template files in "src/report/templates/" (e.g., "html" subdirectory).

## 6. Testing and Refinement
1. Write Jest-based unit tests covering core functionalities in "src/lib/git/" and "src/lib/analysis/".
2. Develop integration tests to validate end-to-end CLI usage (e.g., from "npm start" or bin/git-qa).
3. Focus on user experience by adding clear error messages and a well-structured help output.
4. Update documentation (README.md) explaining installation steps, usage tips, and CLI commands.

This plan ensures a structured approach to building the CLI tool, integrating Git operations, analysis logic, and reporting while enforcing best practices through testing and linting
